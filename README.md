# livegraph
Livegraph is currently in development and has not recieved any public code yet.
If Livegraph is alreade live, here is what it is intended to be:

Livegraph is an open-source software for generating graphics on the fly. You can simply enter the Details you want to have in your graphics, and it outputs a fitting video, which can immediately be sent to a switcher. The WebUI makes it easy to implement. In the future, I want to implement a REST API or something like that, to generate graphics automatically.
